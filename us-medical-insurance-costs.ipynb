This could mean people get their insurance and stuff together in their late 30s referring to the csv. To dive deeper I could compare multiple groups of years 18-28,28-38,38-48, and so on.\n",

To get started, expenses by region at first glance southeast is the most expensive region to have insurance on average, and the southwest has the least expensive region to have insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing that the southeast also has more insurees compared to the differences of the other regions perhaps simply because it is more, or the southeast has more outliers, or one could consider that it has more males in the area according to our breakdown of average male vs female. Which could help further my reasoning for both or prove my reasonings vague. Other possible outlooks could: be a variance of ages in the regions, who smoke, who has children, and possibly a particular BMI may be factored in for those regions, north vs. south areas and west vs. east areas because the south has the least expensive and most expensive areas in the southern hemisphere, and ranking the regions from most to least.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of those outlooks could also provide further data on whether or not those factors, further my reasoning for the concept that males are charged more than females according to the csv, and the same with those with and without children, how those without children pay less. What regions have the least amount of children, that is male or female? Answering these questions will provide me with more information to better determine the most costly factors and possibly how much they can affect your overall cost whether it be age, sex, the region you live in, how many children you have, and BMI ( though not an accurate predictor of health but insurers still tend to use it)."
