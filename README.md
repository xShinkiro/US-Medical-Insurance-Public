# US-MEDICAL-INSURANCE

Project Overview
For this project, you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

Project Objectives:
Work locally on your own computer
Import a dataset into your program
Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
Use libraries to assist in your analysis
Optional: Document and organize your findings
Optional: Make predictions about a datasetâ€™s features based on your findings
